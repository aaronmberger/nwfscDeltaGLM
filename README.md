nwfscDeltaGLM
=============

Bayesian stratified delta-GLMM software for standardizing fishery-independent index data for U.S. West Coast.

Please use R version >=3.1.0 and install using:

    # Install package
    install.packages("devtools")
    library("devtools")
    install_github("nwfsc-assess/nwfscDeltaGLM")
    # Load package
    library(nwfscDeltaGLM)

Please see examples folder (i.e., https://github.com/nwfsc-assess/nwfscDeltaGLM/blob/master/examples/Example_delta-GLMM.R) for an example of how to run the model.
